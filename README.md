**Phishing Simulator**  

**How to run:**  
1. Copy repo into your computer.  
2. Run PhishingSim.html.  
3. Fill in the fields with your information or just click cancel and use the default data.  
4. Interact with the mock site to understand the process of the phishing scam.  

**Note:**  
Clicking "yes, it was me" or ignoring means the victim is not duped. Clicking "no, secure account"  
and moving forward to input the victim's current password into the site and clicking confirm will  
mean that the victim has been duped. The simulation shows how the victim is coaxed into giving up  
their personal information (their password in this case) which is then sent to the attacker's  
database (represented by a public google doc).

Feel free to fork this repo and adjust it to create better educational phishing simulations.
